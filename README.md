# Fleet Management Analytics Project - Power BI

## 1. Project Overview
Fleet management is a critical component of transportation and logistics businesses, impacting cost efficiency, operational performance, and sustainability. This project leverages **Power BI** to analyze a fleet dataset, uncover key insights, and drive data-driven decision-making.

## 2. Objectives

### üöõ Fleet Performance Optimization
- Analyze vehicle efficiency by tracking fuel consumption, speed, and odometer readings.
- Identify high-maintenance vehicles and their breakdown trends.
- Assess the cost-effectiveness of different vehicle models.

### üí∞ Cost & Sustainability Analysis
- Evaluate fuel costs and maintenance expenses by region and vehicle type.
- Analyze CO2 emissions to optimize eco-friendly fleet management.
- Identify cost-saving opportunities by improving fuel efficiency and reducing idle time.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk & Compliance Monitoring
- Monitor vehicles with upcoming insurance expirations to avoid legal issues.
- Assess route risk levels and breakdown incidents per region.
- Identify driver performance trends based on experience, trip efficiency, and risk levels.

## 3. Data Analysis & Insights

### üöõ Fleet Performance Optimization
- **Finding:** Vehicles with lower average speed tend to have higher fuel consumption.
- **Insight:** Fuel efficiency decreases significantly when idle time is above 30%.
- **Business Impact:** Identifying high-maintenance vehicles helps reduce downtime and operational costs.

### üí∞ Cost & Sustainability Analysis
- **Finding:** Diesel-powered vehicles contribute to 60% of total CO2 emissions.
- **Insight:** Region-wise fuel costs vary due to different fuel prices and fleet efficiency.
- **Business Impact:** Strategic investment in fuel-efficient models can lower costs and emissions.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk & Compliance Monitoring
- **Finding:** 15% of vehicles have insurance expiring in the next 30 days.
- **Insight:** High-risk routes have 40% more breakdown incidents than low-risk routes.
- **Business Impact:** Proactive insurance renewal and optimized route planning can reduce risks and ensure compliance.

## 4. Business Strategies & Recommendations
